## What was done

- Hotkey Main window
- Partially Hotkey Edit window
- window resizing, dragging, z-index in order which open (based on browser size)
- ui design which need to improve

## Whats missing

- Many sections in edit - too complicated to implement
- Any interaction with state - its just demo

## How it should look like
